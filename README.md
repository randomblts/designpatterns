# React Design Patterns

As a software engineer, you may not have encountered the term "Design Patterns," but rest assured, you are likely already applying similar principles in your software development work. Design patterns can be thought of as clever approaches to assembling blocks of code in order to effectively address recurring problems in programming. They provide efficient and proven solutions to common challenges, making the process of building software more streamlined and effective.

Design patterns are typically categorized into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. But since this is related to React, I will add in an additional group as UI patterns.
